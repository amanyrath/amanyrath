# 👋 Hi, I'm Alexis Manyrath

I'm a data scientist and technical generalist passionate about building thoughtful AI products. I recently earned my MS in Data Science from UT Austin and thrive at the intersection of product, engineering, and communication.

I'm currently exploring roles that blend **technical problem-solving, user empathy, and rapid iteration** — especially in early-stage or high-impact teams.

## 🛠️ What I Do

- 🤖 **AI/ML Solutions Engineering** – from model evaluation to deployment & customer enablement  
- 📊 **Data Science & Analytics** – Python, SQL, Pandas, visualization, storytelling  
- 🌱 **Human-in-the-Loop Systems** – worked with RLHF, annotation tooling, and prompt optimization  
- 🧠 **Learning & Teaching** – I love explaining technical concepts clearly and mentoring others
