# 👋 Hi, I'm Alexis Manyrath

I'm a data scientist and technical generalist passionate about building thoughtful AI products. I recently earned my MS in Data Science from UT Austin and thrive at the intersection of product, engineering, and communication.

I'm currently exploring roles that blend **technical problem-solving, user empathy, and rapid iteration** especially in early-stage or high-impact teams.

Here are some projects I've deployed recently:

[Tutoring Churn Dashboard](https://tutor-psi-teal.vercel.app/)

[AI Video Generator](https://ai-video-generation-pipeline-production.up.railway.app/)

[Figma Clone](https://collab-canvas-ivory.vercel.app/)
